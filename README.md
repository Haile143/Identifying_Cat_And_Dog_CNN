# Identifying_GIving_Picture_Is_a_Cat_Or_Dog
# Using CNN
* This Project is to recognise cats and dogs

* Here I have explored Convolution Neural Network to classify Image

* Used multiple convolution Layer, Dense layer and different activation functions.

* Trained model with 25 epochs.

* Model Predicted Dog Image Correctly.
